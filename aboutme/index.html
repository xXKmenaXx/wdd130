    <p>Hi everyone.</p>
    <p>Just to share a little bit about myself, I am from Houston. I am currently working on my business management degree. Towards the end of this semester, my wife and I will be expecting our very first baby to be born.</p>
    <p>I took a course on introduction to coding and absolutely loved learning how to code, so I am really excited about learning more about html and getting started on CSS. </p>
