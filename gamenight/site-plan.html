        It will consist of a clear inviting message to come and join us for our next game night. 
        On the home page, a calander will be displayed that will show when the next game night is available. 
        This page will display a section where the viewer will be prompted to fill out some information if they are interested in joining a game night that has already been scheduled or for any upcoming available dates.
        A button will also be displayed that will allow the viewer to RSVP for any given game night as filled out by the prompts above the button.

        The discription will include a brief synopsis of the game and details such as how many players can play the game at a time, a complexity rating to show if the game is either complicated or easy to either set up or play,
        and any recommendations or feedback from previous guests regarding the game. 
        Similar to the board game section, there will be a video game section that will also list out the available games and consoles that may be played.
        A short description of the game will also be included.
